# Datepicker powered by Typescript and RxJS
This project was built using _mainly_
- Mobile first approach
- RxJS 5.2
- Typescript 2.2.1
- Jest

## What was my motivation?
TL;DR -> I want to learn RxJS

I found RxJS *SUPER CHALLENGING* and I think the best way to learn is to build something, that's how this mini project was born.

### Why Typescript?
I wanted to learn to use Typescript outside the Angular world.
